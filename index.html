                    Each player is mounted on a broomstick and attempts to win the game by having more
                    points than their opponents by the time the Golden Snitch is caught (which in this
                    version of the game, is a tennis ball in a long yellow sock).The object of the game of Quidditch is to score more points than your opponents.
                    Players do this by scoring goals which is done by placing a slightly deflated volleyball
                    called the Quaffle into the opposition's baskets giving them 10 points, and by capturing
                    the Golden Snitch which is worth 30 points.
